# SAS Studio Tasks

This repository hosts SAS-provided tasks and contributed custom tasks to extend SAS Studio.  File types include:

- CTM files:  the XML and Apache Velocity code that is used to create the user interface and generate the SAS code for the task.
- CTK files: a task that is saved with one or more options already selected.  Using a CTK file makes it easier to run the same task with the same settings over and over again. 
- XML files: define task repository structures and SAS code snippet libraries
- SAS files: SAS program files

For more "How to" information, see [SAS Studio Developer's Guide for Writing Custom Tasks](https://go.documentation.sas.com/?docsetId=webeditordg&docsetTarget=titlepage.htm&docsetVersion=3.8&locale=en).
